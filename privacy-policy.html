  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 20, 2025</p>

  <p>
    The Japanese Learning Assistant Extension is designed to help users translate and learn Japanese
    through context-aware translation, Kanji reading, and grammar explanation. We take your privacy seriously.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    This extension <strong>does not collect, store, or share any personal information</strong> from users.
    The only data used is the text you select on a webpage, which is temporarily sent to the OpenAI API for the purpose of generating a translation and explanation.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Use of OpenAI API</h2>
  <p>
    When you select Japanese text and trigger the extension, your selected sentence is sent securely to the OpenAI API.
    The response includes translation, Kanji readings, grammar notes, and pronunciation.
    No identifying information is attached or transmitted.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Local Storage</h2>
  <p>
    The extension uses Chromeâ€™s <code>storage.sync</code> to remember your selected language. This is stored locally in your browser and is not transmitted or shared.
  </p>

  <h2>4. No Third-Party Access</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, trade, or transfer your data to any third parties. All operations happen locally or securely via OpenAI.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Website Content Access</h2>
  <p>
    This extension temporarily accesses <strong>only the text that users manually select</strong> on any website
    in order to provide translations, Kanji readings, and grammar explanations.
    It does not read or access other elements such as images, links, videos, or the full page content.
    No data is stored or collected. The selected text is used only for the purpose of sending to the OpenAI API and is discarded immediately after a response is received.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to Policy</h2>
  <p>
    If there are any changes to this privacy policy, they will be published directly here in this document with an updated date.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy, please contact us via the Chrome Web Store support page.
  </p>

  <p>Thank you for using our extension!</p>
